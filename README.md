### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Redis AOF File Corruption Incident
---

Redis AOF (Append-Only File) File Corruption Incident is an issue that occurs when the data in the Redis AOF file becomes corrupt and unreadable. This can happen due to multiple reasons such as power outages, hardware failures, or software bugs. When the Redis AOF file becomes corrupt, it can lead to a loss of critical data or application downtime. It is important to have a process in place to monitor and handle such incidents to minimize the impact on business operations.

### Parameters
```shell
export PATH_TO_AOF_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_LATEST_BACKUP="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_RDB_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_REDIS_AOF_BACKUP_DIRECTORY="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_REDIS_DATA_DIRECTORY="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check if Redis server is running
```shell
systemctl status redis
```

### Check Redis logs for any error messages related to AOF file
```shell
grep "AOF" /var/log/redis/redis-server.log
```

### Verify the AOF file is being written
```shell
redis-cli info persistence | grep aof_enabled
```

### Verify the current AOF file size
```shell
redis-cli info persistence | grep aof_current_size
```

### Check for errors in the AOF file
```shell
redis-check-aof ${PATH_TO_AOF_FILE}
```

### If errors found, try to fix the AOF file
```shell
redis-check-aof --fix ${PATH_TO_AOF_FILE}
```

### If fixing the AOF file fails, restore from latest backup
```shell
cp ${PATH_TO_LATEST_BACKUP} ${PATH_TO_AOF_FILE}
```

### If no backup available, use Redis RDB file to recover data
```shell
redis-cli --rdb ${PATH_TO_RDB_FILE}
```

### Restart Redis server
```shell
systemctl restart redis
```

## Repair

### Restore from backup: If a recent backup is available, restore the Redis AOF file from the backup and verify the data integrity.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash



# Set the variables

BACKUP_DIR=${PATH_TO_REDIS_AOF_BACKUP_DIRECTORY}

REDIS_DATA_DIR=${PATH_TO_REDIS_DATA_DIRECTORY}



# Stop Redis server

systemctl stop redis



# Restore Redis AOF file from backup

cp $BACKUP_DIR/appendonly.aof $REDIS_DATA_DIR/appendonly.aof



# Verify data integrity

redis-check-aof $REDIS_DATA_DIR/appendonly.aof



# Start Redis server

systemctl start redis


```

### Repair the AOF file: Use Redis tools such as `redis-check-aof` to repair the AOF file and recover as much data as possible.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Check if redis-check-aof command exists

if ! command -v redis-check-aof &> /dev/null

then

    echo "redis-check-aof command could not be found. Aborting script."

    exit 1

fi



# Set the path to the Redis AOF file

AOF_FILE_PATH=${PATH_TO_AOF_FILE}



# Check if the Redis AOF file exists

if [ ! -f "$AOF_FILE_PATH" ]

then

    echo "Redis AOF file could not be found. Aborting script."

    exit 1

fi



# Check if the Redis AOF file is corrupt

if redis-check-aof $AOF_FILE_PATH | grep -q "AOF seems to start with an RDB"

then

    echo "Redis AOF file is not corrupt. Aborting script."

    exit 1

fi



# Try to repair the Redis AOF file

echo "Repairing Redis AOF file..."

redis-check-aof --fix $AOF_FILE_PATH



# Check if the Redis AOF file is still corrupt

if redis-check-aof $AOF_FILE_PATH | grep -q "AOF seems to start with an RDB"

then

    echo "Redis AOF file could not be repaired. Aborting script."

    exit 1

fi



echo "Redis AOF file has been repaired successfully."
